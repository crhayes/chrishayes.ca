title: Using whereHas() with HasManyThrough Relationships

Iâ€™ve discovered an issue with Eloquent in which using the `whereHas()` method with a `HasManyThrough` relationship returns the wrong results.

For instance, if I have the following model structure:

```
Business
  - hasMany Lead
  - hasManyThrough Purchase (through Lead)

Lead
  - belongsTo Business
  - hasOne Purchase

Purchase
  - belongsTo Lead
```

the following code will yield unexpected results:

```php
$businesses = Business::whereHas('purchases', function($query)
{
    $query->where( // insert where clause here );
})->get();
```

Iâ€™ve sent a pull request to fix the issue but it needs to be discussed, so for now you can do use nested `whereHas()` calls like so:

```php
$businesses = Business::whereHas('leads', function($query)
{
	$query->whereHas('purchase', function($query)
	{
		$query->where( // insert where clause here );
	});
})
->get();
```
