I released my first Laravel 4 package today, which is a couple of classes that build on top of Laravel’s Validator library.

Take a look at this snippet, then [view the project on Github](https://github.com/crhayes/laravel-extended-validator) to see how it can assist your validation.

```php
$userValidator = UserValidator::make(Input::only('first_name', 'last_name'))
    ->addContext('create');
$carValidator = CarValidator::make(Input::only('make', 'model'))
    ->addContext('create');

$groupedValidator = GroupedValidator::make()
    ->addValidator($userValidator)
    ->addValidator($carValidator);

if ($groupedValidator->passes()) {
    // yay
}
```

The main reasons I created this package are:

1. To ease the creation of validation services – we all know validaton should be moved out of the controller
2. Provide an easy way to provide context for validations – such as providing a modified set of validation rules for edit vs. create
3. Provide an easy way to group validations – that is, calling one `passes()` method to validate multiple models

It is documented on Github and I’ll write a more in depth blog post about it in the near future.

For now, [visit the project on Github](https://github.com/crhayes/laravel-extended-validator)!
