I found an article by Mark van Eijk that outlines [how to easily cache Eloquent results](http://markvaneijk.com/quick-tip-caching-eloquent-in-laravel-4) by using the following syntax:

```php
$articles = Article::with('comments')->remember(5)->get();
```

I wanted to point out that in the event you want to cache all articles, the following syntax doesn’t work

```php
$articles = Article::all()->remember(5); // doesn't work
```

What you need to do instead is the following:

```php
$articles = Article::remember(5)->get(); // works great!
```

You can verify the query is not run on subsequent requests by dd’ing the queries that were run during the request:

```php
dd(\DB::getQueryLog());
```

Hope this helps someone! If you have any Laravel tricks of your own post them in the comments below.
